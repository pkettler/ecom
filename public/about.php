            <h3>Our story</h3>
            <h4>In 2020 our family moved to Marysville,
                California. My husband was freshly out of basic
                training. Neither of us was from California nor
                knew anything about the city we moved to. We
                barely had any belongings moving out of state
                and we struggled to find the items we needed
                at a price we could afford. With my love for
                interior décor and my husband's knowledge of
                running a business, we decided to start a
                furniture business that would help other fellow
                military families. We carefully choose
                handcrafted furniture and décor to offer our
                consumers at a reasonable price.</h4>
